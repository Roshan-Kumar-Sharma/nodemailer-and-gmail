# nodemailer-and-gmail

In this project, I have used nodemailer and googleapis to send email to any user's account.

## nodemailer

Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. Go for documentation [nodemailer docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/). 

To install
```bash
$ npm i nodemailer
```

## googleapis

Node.js client library for using Google APIs. Go for documentation [Google API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/googleapis#google-apis)

To install
```bash
$ npm i googleapis
```

## Usage

To use gmail as transporter, you will have to setup account on **console.cloud.google.com**. You will get all the authorization token, refresh token  and access token there...
